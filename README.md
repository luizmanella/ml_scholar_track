<h1>Machine Learning - Scholar Track</h1>
<p>
The goal is to build a comprehensive, academic curriculum for machine learning/artificial intelligence. Today, where AI is predicted to be the most game changing technology, we still
lack a degree built for people who want to be experts in the topic. The current stance is, pick a degree, then tack on "ML" as as a specialty by taking 2-3 classes on the subject.
I believe experts in this field, as is done in science and mathematics, should be taught from a first principles approach. To that extent, this is my take on what that looks like.
I hope to grow this to the first of its kind, and that someone with the power to implement this in a university takes note and does something with it.
